# Vocabulary-Builder
Counts words in .txt and some .pdf files, organizing them by highest frequency

A simple python code that converts the text of a .txt or .pdf file into a list of strings.
Each unique word is counted and a new list is created containing the word and it's frequency in the text.
This list is saved as .CSV file.

The code is useful when reading text in foregin languages. It gives an overview of words you'll see in the text. The most frequently occuring words will be the articles (if the language has articles), and this code could easily be modified to exclude the articles, but depending on ones familiarity with the language the articles may be instructive. 


## Example:

### Input
Le Soleil
Le long du vieux faubourg, où pendent aux masures
Les persiennes, abri des secrètes luxures,
